Another game I'm working on while practicing Unity. Game is playable but not much to do.

Controls:
Shift - Focus (Slows you down and shows your hitbox)
Mouse1 - Fire
WASD or Arrow Keys - Movement

Currently there is no quit button so you'll have to tab out to close the application.
Likewise if you die you'll also have to tab out and close the application.
